##Concept

<p>The idea behind harrywishyouwell is to provide a way for people to take short notes secretly.<br>
Some times, you see something that you want to write down but you're affraid that people will read what you're writting.</p>
<p>With harrywishyouwell, this is history. Just visit the website, enter your email address and type your text, hit enter and you're done!<p>
<p>You'll then receive a "regular mail from a friend" with your secret note inside. You can filter it so it won't appear in your inbox and read it later.<p>
